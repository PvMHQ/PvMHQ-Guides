.tag:intro
The Chambers of Xeric, is the first Raid introduced to Oldschool Runescape. The Chambers of Xeric is located on the island of Zeah and has no requirements to access. The friends chat system is required in order to form a party of 1-100.

.
> **__Scouting__**
.tag:scouting
Scouting is the process of entering a raid and checking the room layout. If the rooms are not desirable, you simply leave and "rescout" the raid.
Scouting good raid rotations increases your GP/Hour drastically, as well as making it easier to find teammates. You need to have a recruit + rank in the friends chat in order to be able to scout.

> **Scouting Process:**
:black_small_square: Make a party at the party board in the Raids Area
:black_small_square: Enter the Raid and check the pop-up of the rotation
:black_small_square: If the Raid looks bad, start the raid then leave
:black_small_square: Rescout for a better raid, and repeat until you find one

The rooms you should do depends on your team composition. 

> **Scouting Rules:**
:black_small_square: Combat rooms do not matter as much as Puzzle rooms.
:black_small_square: Your raid should contain 3 Combat rooms and 2 Puzzle rooms or 4 Combat rooms and 1 Puzzle room.
:black_small_square: Always scout for the Tightrope Puzzle.
:black_small_square: Avoid Unknown Puzzle rooms when possible (previous rule applies).
:black_small_square: Finding a 3c (3 Combat) "Crope" (Crabs + Rope) Raid is ideal.
:black_small_square: Most 3c2p crope should be done and 4c2p crope are mostly done with any 4 of Vasa, Vespula, Muttadiles, Guardians, Lizardman Shamans and Skeletal Mystics.

__**Puzzles**__

**Crabs**
To solve crabs, you must bounce an orb off the crabs into the crystals.
⬥ The orb will always turn clockwise when it bounces off a crab.
⬥ You must change the orbs color to the opposite color of the target crystal.
⬥ You can change the color of the orb by bouncing it off a colored crab.
⬥ You color crabs by using different combat styles as demonstrated:

.

**Ice Demon**
There are two methods to complete this room: chest method and no chest method.
⬥ Chest method:
    • Before starting the room, kill scavs for planks and build a chest.
    • Bank everything in private storage. Grab an axe and tinderbox.
    • Chop an inventory of kindling.
    • Stand by the braziers. Light at the same time.
⬥ No chest method:
    • Sip a dose of stamina and drop all of your remaining potions near the invisible chest space.
    • Grab an axe and tinderbox.
    • Chop as much kindling as you can and light a brazier.
    • Return to cutting kindling and continue to light the same brazier.
⬥ Drop your axe and tinderbox. Click withdraw all from private chest (if chest method).
⬥ Drink a ranging potion and super combat potion.
⬥ Pray ranged and piety. Equip melee gear with DWH/BGS.
⬥ Spec the ice demon with DWH/BGS (unless you have tekton next room then save your spec). 
⬥ Switch into ranged gear and blowpipe. Pray ranged and rigour or eagle eye.
⬥ The ice demon will throw rocks at you. Dodge them by moving two tiles.

⬥ Although not required, fire surge is the best DPS against Ice Demon and it will significantly speed up the room.

.

**Thieving**
Before starting the room, kill scavs for planks and build a chest.
⬥ Bank everything in private storage.
⬥ Alternatively, drop all remaining potions by the invisible chest space.
⬥ Steal grubs from the chests until you have 10-15 grubs.
⬥ If a chest poisons you, don't steal from it again.
⬥ Dump grubs into the trough, continue picking and feeding until the room is complete.
⬥ Although not required, bringing a lockpick will significantly speed up the room.

**Tightrope**
⬥ Do not try to cross the rope upon entering the room.
⬥ Drink a ranging potion. Pray mage and rigour or eagle eye.
⬥ Attack each mager one at a time using tbow or blowpipe.
⬥ Once the magers are dead, pray ranged and rigour or eagle eye.
⬥ Attack each ranger one at a time using blowpipe.
⬥ In layouts with a shadow root, the tank can run behind the shadow root.
⬥ The tank must attack the ranger every few blowpipe hits or it will switch aggro.
⬥ When only one ranger remains, one random person crosses rope.
⬥ Pick up the keystone crystal and use it on the door.
⬥ The scouter is NOT determined to cross the rope. Anyone is allowed to.
